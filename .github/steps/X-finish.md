## Finish

_Congratulations friend, you've completed this course!_

Here's a recap of all the tasks you've accomplished in your repository:

- Made a quarto doc
- Added a python code chunk that generates a great table
- Added a requirements.txt
- Published the Quarto doc to Posit Connect Cloud

Now that your table is on Posit Connect Cloud, you can

1. Share the table. Click the Share icon to copy the URL associated with the table. Anyone can visit your table at this URL.

3. Republish the table whenever you like. To do so, click the republish button in the sidebar.

   Republishing the app will scoop up any changes you've made on GitHub. Posit Connect Cloud will eventually scoop up these changes on its own, but republishing the app makes it happen immediately.

4. You can these features and more associated with your app on your Posit Connect home page.
