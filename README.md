## Welcome

People use GitHub to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you’re visualizing data or building a new game, there’s a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can help you do it even better. GitHub Skills’ “Introduction to GitHub” course guides you through everything you need to start contributing in less than an hour.

- **Who is this for**: Anyone with a great table (made by the Python Great Tables package) who has a burning desire to share it with the world
- **What you'll learn**: We'll introduce Quarto documents and Connect Cloud, a quick free way to host a Quarto document at its own URL.
- **What you'll build**: We'll make a short Quarto document that contains your great table and then post it to its own URL.
- **Prerequisites**: None. If you don't have a great table at hand, we'll lend you one.
- **How long**: You can complete this course in about five minutes if you rush, but why not take your time and make it 10?

In this course, you will:

1. Create a Quarto document (.qmd)
2. Add a python chunk to the document that creates a great table
3. Use your Github Account to sign into Connect Cloud
4. Publish your document to Connect Cloud and admire the attractive table contained therein

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
