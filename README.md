## Welcome

With [Great Tables](https://posit-dev.github.io/great-tables/articles/intro.html) anyone can make wonderful-looking tables in Python. But how do you share them? Here's a simple way: put your table in a Quarto document and then host it for free on Posit Connect Cloud.

- **Who is this for**: Anyone who wants to share a _great table_ via the internet.
- **What you'll learn**: We'll introduce Quarto documents, Great Tables, and Posit Connect Cloud.
- **What you'll build**: You'll make a short Quarto document that contains your great table and then post it to its own URL.
- **Prerequisites**: None. If you don't have a great table, we'll lend you one.
- **How long**: If you rush, you can complete this course in about five minutes; but why not take your time and make it 10?

In this course, you will:

1. Create a Quarto document (.qmd)
2. Add a Python chunk to the document that creates a great table
3. Use your Github Account to sign into Connect Cloud
4. Publish your document to Connect Cloud and admire the attractive table contained therein

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.
